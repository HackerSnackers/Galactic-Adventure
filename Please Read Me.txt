Hey guys!

Remember when we discovered Dictionaries? Yes? Please please please try to incorperate this into the website. This would help make the game functional.

Here's an idea of what it should look like: (Key = C: Choice###

Key		Values (Become keys if found, generally stored as an array or list of some sort)
-------------------------
C1	| [("C2","C3","C6")]
C2	| [("C2","C5","C6")]
C3	| [("")] 		-- What dead end would look likea script would run to restart after a time.sleep(milliseconds) Command
C4 	| [("C3","C6","C7")]
C5	| [("C9000")]		-- Case would be so large nothing could reach it, signaling a victory (How error checking is done)
C6	| [("C7","C8")]
C7	| [("C9000","C3"]	-- Final decision, either victory or death ("Ad Victorian"), can be modified to go back


Definetly think about this and how you would Implement this. Hannah did a great job at working on the JScript and has a bright future in this. 

Aika did a great job in CSS and has a real knack for spacial design

Aaron has a great overall grasp of what is going on

and Beau is great with words and storytelling!

Definetly keep honing your skills and working on this to create a masterpiece!
